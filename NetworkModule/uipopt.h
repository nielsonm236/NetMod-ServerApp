// The maximum number of simultaneously open TCP connections. Since the TCP
// connections are statically allocated, turning this configuration knob down
// results in less RAM used. Each TCP connection requires approximately 30
// bytes of memory.
//
// Comment MN: Experiment shows actual RAM consumption per connection to be
// 40 bytes.
#define UIP_CONNS       4


// The maximum number of simultaneously listening TCP ports. Each listening
// TCP port requires 2 bytes of memory.
//
// Comment MN: Experiment shows the 2 bytes of RAM estimate to be correct.
// Comment MN: In order to allow multiple browsers on >different< IP
// addresses to work UIP_LISTENPORTS had to be the same value as UIP_CONNS.
// Examining the uip.c code did not explain why this is the case.
// Comment MN: Note that the MQTT port does not require an entry in the
// listen ports table. It is handled separately. However, MQTT DOES require
// an entry in the uip_conns table. So, when MQTT is in use there can be a
// maximum of 3 Browser connections.
#define UIP_LISTENPORTS 4


// The initial retransmission timeout counted in timer pulses.
// This should not be changed.
#define UIP_RTO         3


// The maximum number of times a segment should be retransmitted before the
// connection should be aborted.
// This should not be changed.
#define UIP_MAXRTX      8

// The TCP Maximum Segment size. This should be set to no more than
// UIP_BUFSIZE - UIP_LLH_LEN - UIP_TCPIP_HLEN. This ends up being the maximum
// size of the part of the datagram that can be transmitted to the Browser or
// to the MQTT server in each packet.
//
// NOTE1: Experimentation has shown that the UIP_TCP_MSS should actually be
// slightly smaller than the original code defined. "Slightly" appears to be
// at least 4 bytes. This is to avoid errors (not sure why and could use more
// investigation). To be safe an additional 6 bytes are subtracted.
//
// // if NAGLE_SUPPORT == 1
//
// NOTE2: When MQTT support was added two problems occurred:
// 1) It was found that during MQTT startup, if Home Assistant Auto Discovery
//    was used, a larger uip_buf was needed to trasnmit some of the Auto
//    Discovery messages in a single packet. This consumed nearly all the
//    available RAM.
// 2) Later it was found that Home Assistant used Nagle's Algorithm to pack
//    multiple MQTT messages into single datagrams, AND that those datagrams
//    could span multiple packets when transmitted to the Network Module. So,
//    memory was needed to deconstruct the datagram into individual MQTT
//    messages and to reconstruct the MQTT messages that spanned a packet
//    boundary.
// To handle the above the upper part of the uip_buf is made available for use
// as an "MQTT partial buffer" (a receive reconstruction buffer) after MQTT
// startup has completed. This is done by making the UIP_TCP_MSS value smaller
// by another 60 bytes, then using pointers based on a "MQTT_PBUF" define to
// access the memory area.
// // endif NAGLE_SUPPORT == 1
//

// UIP_STATISTICS
// Determines if Network Statistics support should be compiled in. Network
// Statistics are useful for debugging Network related problems. If you are
// modifying the project and need more program space eliminating the Network
// Statistics pages and processes will free up considerable space.
// Note that Network Statistics will not fit in the memory when an MQTT build
// is created. It will only fit if a Browser Only build is created. So,
//    UIP_STATISTICS == 1 will be ignored
//    unless BUILD_SUPPORT == BROWSER_ONLY_BUILD
// Generally UIP_STATISTICS is alway set to 1 and the build controls will
// manage it.
// 0 = disabled
// 1 = included
#define UIP_STATISTICS 1


// DEBUG_SUPPORT
// Determines if DEBUG code is compiled in
//
// DEBUG support allocates EEPROM and RAM space to collect debug data and
// store it in the EEPROM for viewing with the STVP programmer, the UART, or
// with the Link Error Stats web page.
// Most of these functions are only useful during code development, however
// the Link Error Stats web page is very useful to the end user to determine
// if Full Duplex works better with their specific switch vs the default Half
// Duplex. For this reason DEBUG_SUPPORT 11 should be the default setting for
// production code.
//
// 7 =  10 bytes of debug[] allocated to specific debug data*
//      UART TX enabled on IO pin 11
//      No Link Error Stats browser page
//      USAGE: Useful mode for displaying most in-development debug without
//      the overhead of the Link Error Stats web page.
// 11 = USE FOR PRODUCTION BUILDS.
//      10 bytes of debug allocated to specific debug data*
//      No UART
//      Link Error Stats browser page enabled
//      USAGE: provides the user with the Link Error Stats in a web page
//      without the overhead of the UART functionality.
// 15 = 10 bytes of debug allocated to specific debug data*
//      UART TX enabled on IO pin 11
//      Link Error Stats browser page enabled
//      USAGE: Provides the most run time error data and UART display.
// * Specific debug data: Reset Status Register counters, TXERIF counter,
//   RXERIF counter, Stack Overflow bit, and ENC28J60 revision level.
#define DEBUG_SUPPORT 11


// IWDG_ENABLE
// Determines if the Independent Watchdog is to be enabled
// For production code this should me enabled. It turns on the IWDG to cause a
// hardware reset after 1 second of the code failing to reset the watchdog,
// which implies some kind of fatal error occurred. The reset will re-enable
// access to the Network Module.
// For development it may be necessary to prevent the IDWG from operating as it
// may interfere with debug code.
// 0 = disable
// 1 = enable
#define IWDG_ENABLE 1


// BUILD_SUPPORT
// Determines the type of code build to create.
// MQTT_BUILD includes MQTT support and Home Assistant support, but excludes
//   the Browser Only IO Names and IO Timers. This build selection will
//   over-ride the UIP_STATISTICS setting forcing it to be disabled.
// BROWSER_ONLY_BUILD excludes MQTT support but includes the extra Browser
//   only features like IO Names and IO Timers.
// CODE_UPLOADER_BUILD excludes all Browser Only and MQTT features. It produces
//   a build that can only be used to upload and update the runtime code. The
//   Code Uploader requires additional hardware in the form of an off-board I2C
//   EEPROM, thus OB_EEPROM_SUPPORT and I2C_SUPPORT must be enabled.
// Un-comment ONLY ONE of the following:
// #define BUILD_SUPPORT     MQTT_BUILD
// #define BUILD_SUPPORT     BROWSER_ONLY_BUILD
#define BUILD_SUPPORT     CODE_UPLOADER_BUILD


// I2C_SUPPORT
// Determines if I2C Support is to be compiled into the build. I2C_SUPPORT
// enables use of various I2C devices using IO pins 14 and 15 as the I2C data
// and clock pins.
// 0 = Not supported
// 1 = Supported
#define I2C_SUPPORT 1


// OB_EEPROM_SUPPORT
// Determines if Off-Board EEPROM support is to be compiled into the build.
// Off-Board EEPROM support adds the ability to upload new firmware to the
// device via the Ethernet connection. Off-Board EEPROM support also enables
// off-board storage of some webpage templates in a "Strings File" to make
// more STM8 Flash space available for use as code space. The requirements to
// use this function are:
// 1) An Off-Board I2C EEPROM must be added that provides 256KB of off-board
//    EEPROM space (see the manual). This requires use of IO pins 14 and 15
//    for the I2C bus.
// 2) I2C Support MUST be enabled.
// 3) The Code Uploader version of the code must be loaded via the SWIM
//    interface at least one time. After that the Code Uploader will have
//    copied itself into the Off-Board EEPROM and, in the future, the Code
//    Uploader code will be obtained from that location.
// 4) When code updates are perfromed the Code Uploader must be used to
//    a) Load the Strings File
//    b) Load the Runtime code
// 0 = Not supported
// 1 = Supported
#define OB_EEPROM_SUPPORT 1


// DEBUG_SENSOR_SERIAL
// Determines if the Display Temperature Sensor Serial Numbers support is
// to be compiled into the build. This is for DIAGNOSTIC support during
// development and is not expected to be part of normal releases. When
// enabled URL command /71 will display all serial number as read from the
// sensors.
// 0 = Not Supported
// 1 = Supported
#define DEBUG_SENSOR_SERIAL 0


// NAGLE_SUPPORT
// Temporary build setting to enable support of Nagle's Algorithm in the MQTT
// code.
// THIS IS A TEMPORARY BUILD MODE. WHEN TESTING IS COMPLETE MODIFY THE CODE TO
// ALWAYS USE NAGLE'S ALGORITHM THEN DELETE THIS OPTION.
// 0 = No Nagle's Algorithm support
// 1 = Supported
// #define NAGLE_SUPPORT 1


// LINKED_SUPPORT
// Temporary build setting to enable support of Linked Input to Output pins.
// THIS IS A TEMPORARY BUILD MODE. WHEN TESTING IS COMPLETE MODIFY THE CODE TO
// ALWAYS USE Linked Support THEN DELETE THIS OPTION.
// 0 = No Linked Support
// 1 = Supported
#define LINKED_SUPPORT 1

 * the type uip_tcp_appstate_t.
 *
 * The file containing the definitions must be included in the uipopt.h file.
 *
 * The following example illustrates how this can look.
